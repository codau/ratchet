## WIP!
This package is still under development and was not yet published!

accounts-templates-ratchet
==========================

Meteor sign up and sign in templates (and much more!) styled for Ratchet

This package depends on [accounts-templates-core](https://atmospherejs.com/package/accounts-templates-core)

Learn more [here](http://accounts-templates.meteor.com) or have a look at a [live demo application](http://accounts-templates-ratchet.meteor.com).


## Warning!

Adding this package with `mrt add accounts-templates-ratchet` does not add any other packages providing Ratchet. This is to let you choose the flavour you prefer, being it compiled, less, sass, or from CDN!
